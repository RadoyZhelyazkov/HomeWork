            <p class="info">
                Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless
                chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and
                the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life,
                even though it provides neither food, energy, nor organic micronutrients. Its
                chemical formula, <em>H<sup>2</sup>O</em>, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen
                and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atomsare attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of
                104.45&deg;. "Water" is the name of the liquid state of <em>H<sup>2</sup>O</em> at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. A
                number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in the form of rain
                and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water
                and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in
                the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water
                covers about 70.9&percnt; of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans. Small
                portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7&percnt;), in the glaciers and the ice caps
                of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7&percnt;), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting
                of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001&percnt;). Water
                moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration
                (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching
                the sea.
